For more than a decade, my work has revolved around one single question:
## How far can electronic paper go?

When I co-founded DASUNG in 2014, the mission was clear — make the world’s first E Ink computer monitor. Back then, everyone thought ePaper could only be used for reading. We wanted to prove that it could also be a real display — one that lets your eyes work, code, and create all day long without fatigue.

It was an exciting time.
We pushed E Ink technology to its limits: optimizing waveforms, chasing every millisecond of refresh speed, inventing driving algorithms to make grayscale videos playable on a display that wasn’t supposed to move that fast.
It was, in every sense, about speed — turning stillness into motion.

## A Different Kind of Challenge

Years later, I realized something interesting:
The pursuit of “fast” had already reached its edge.
But what if the true beauty of ePaper lies not in motion, but in quietness?

When I left DASUNG, I wanted to explore the other side of this medium — how it could blend into everyday life, not just work.
That’s when InkJoy Frame was born — a project to bring full-color ePaper into our living spaces, like art that breathes slowly with light.

## From Office to Home

In the office, an E Ink monitor is a tool — it fights eye strain and distraction.
At home, an ePaper frame becomes something else entirely:
It doesn’t ask for your attention.
It simply exists — calm, reflective, and beautiful in its own rhythm.

Unlike LCD or OLED, an ePaper image doesn’t flicker, doesn’t glow, and doesn’t consume power to exist.
It’s still, yet alive.
And that paradox is exactly what fascinates me.

## Where We Are Now

At InkJoy, our focus is on color ePaper — particularly E Ink Spectra™ 6.
This new generation of electrophoretic displays can reproduce vivid tones while keeping that same matte texture and paper-like feel.

We’re still refining color mapping, contrast balancing, and image rendering — problems that seem small, but define how “real” the picture feels. Each improvement brings ePaper closer to what I imagine:
A living artwork that never demands attention.

Looking Ahead

This blog, ePaper Frame, is where I plan to share that journey — both the breakthroughs and the imperfections.
Sometimes it will be about waveforms and color models; sometimes, about philosophy and the meaning of “slowness” in technology.

If you’ve ever been fascinated by the way ePaper catches ambient light,
or wondered how a display could feel quiet,
then I hope these stories will resonate with you.
