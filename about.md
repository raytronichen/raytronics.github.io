# About

This website is currently operated by Ray Chen.

I'm the founder of InkJoy Frame Color ePaper Frame and the inventor of e-ink computer monitors (co-founder & former CTO of DASUNG Technology). I have been focusing on the innovation and application of e-ink display technology since 2013, committed to bringing this eye-friendly technology to more users. As the inventor of e-ink computer monitors, I promoted the application of e-ink display technology in the computer field during my time at DASUNG Technology. Now, I founded InkJoy Frame, focusing on developing color e-ink frame products, combining art and technology perfectly.
